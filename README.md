### Hi there!

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile. My name is Emilly, and I prefer she/her pronouns. I'm currently working as a software developer intern at CI&T, where I'm learning all about Java and other exciting technologies like Springboot and Docker. 
When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time experimenting in the kitchen and staying active with regular workouts. Take a look around my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to connect.
